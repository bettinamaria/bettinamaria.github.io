## Explanation

This is my personal portfolio website made with Jekyll to showcase my web dev projects and blog posts.

## Problem

To build and setup the website, I had to learn how to fork and clone a Jekyll theme. In addition, I had to look into how to create a 'contact page', add Google Analytics to track website visitors and deploy the site via Github pages. SASS was embedded so I gained insights as to the differences to CSS; and learnt more about markup language specific to Jekyll.

## Results

It's great to have one live website hosted through Github pages on the internet, even though this first portfolio site is still a 'work in progress' for now.


## Conclusion

This project will be continuously updated when I finish new projects.
